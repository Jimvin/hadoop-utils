Socrates (ca. 469-399 BCE) is hailed as one of the founders of Western
philosophy, however, very little is known about him as a historical figure and
philosopher. The best account of life and work of one of the most influential
philosophers of all times is given by the later classical writers, in the first
place by his students Plato and Xenophon and the playwright Aristophanes who was
his contemporary. Despite that, the mentioned writers reveal that the ancient
Greek philosopher made important contributions to philosophy as well as
epistemology and logic. He is the inventor of the so-called Socratic method or
elenchus which remains one of the most commonly used approaches not only to
answer the fundamental questions of philosophy but it also serves as a tool for
scientific research. Ironically, the most famous Socrates’ saying is “I only
know that I know nothing”.
